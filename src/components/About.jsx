              Hello! I'm Tunahan, a 17-year-old front-end developer living in
              Bursa, Turkey. My passion and curiosity for web design have driven
              me to pursue growth in this field. Although I may not have
              extensive experience, I am constantly eager to learn and explore
              new technologies. My goal is to further develop myself by creating
              impactful and functional web projects that resonate with users. I
              strive to offer creative and innovative solutions. If you are
              interested in collaborating on projects or need assistance, I
              would be delighted to hear from you.
            </p>
